Put loadstring before, then you can use like this;

notificationTitle = "Update"
notificationMessage = "New feature added!"
showNotification(5)

-------------------------------------------------------

notificationTitle = the bigger text in the notification, the title.
notificationMessage = the smaller text in the notification, the subtext some may say.
showNotification(num) = num is the number of seconds the message shows for, if get's a negative num, it'll goto 2.5 seconds.
